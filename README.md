# albert-python-remmina
An albert python module to quickly open remmina connections.

# Installation
Maybe the extension gets into the main albert repository some day. Until then, the module must be installed manually like this:
```
cd /usr/share/albert/org.albert.extension.python/modules
git clone https://github.com/KuenzelIT/albert-python-remmina remmina
```
The module can then be activated using the python extension in albert.
